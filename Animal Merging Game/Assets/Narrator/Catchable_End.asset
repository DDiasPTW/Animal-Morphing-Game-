  - Can't say I'm surprised
  - You actually didn't catch it... wow
  - Oh, the disappointment is palpable.
  - Looks like catching it was just too much to ask.
  - Missed it by THAT much? Better luck next time!
  - Ah, the sweet sound of failure.
  - You didn't catch it? I guess we can't all be winners.
  - And just when I thought you might actually do it... you didn't.
  - You didn't catch it? We really have to keep going so please pick it up.
  - Didn't catch it? I'm starting to think you enjoy disappointing me.
  - Missed it! Are you even trying anymore?
  - Looks like we'll be here a while.
