  - Hahahha, don't trip
  - You actually fell for that?
  - Oops, looks like someone forgot how gravity works.
  - I've seen penguins with better balance.
  - Well, that was an award-winning nosedive!
  - They say practice makes perfect, but in your case, it just makes me sad.
  - 'Gravity: 1, You: 0. Better luck next time!'
  - Well, that was a spectacular display of 'how not to jump.
