  - That's quite embarrassing, this data will be no good
  - Nice one. Did you do it with your eyes closed?
  - Oh wow, you actually finished. I was starting to give up on you, not gonna lie.
  - I didn't even know this was possible.
  - I know you shouldn't worry about the timer too much, but really?
  - Well, you certainly set the bar low.
  - Did you get lost?
  - I'm not even mad, I'm just disappointed
  - Zero? Really? Did I give you the capivara genes by accident?
